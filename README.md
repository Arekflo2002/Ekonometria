# üìä Workplace Accidents in Poland (2021) - Econometric Analysis  

## **Project Overview**  
This project examines the factors influencing the number of people injured in workplace accidents across subregions in Poland in 2021. Using econometric modeling, we explore how various socio-economic and infrastructural variables impact workplace accident rates.  

## **Research Hypotheses**  
1. **Higher registered unemployment rates lead to fewer workplace accident victims.**  
2. **An increase in the number of boiler houses significantly contributes to a higher number of workplace accidents.**  
3. **A higher number of marriages correlates with an increased number of workplace accident victims.**  
4. **Higher investment expenditures per capita in enterprises result in a greater number of workplace accidents.**  

## **Findings & Conclusions**  
- The model meets all estimation method assumptions but has a high forecasting error, making it unsuitable for accurate predictions.  
- **Hypothesis 1:** ‚ùå False ‚Äì Unemployment rate was not statistically significant in the model.  
- **Hypothesis 2:** ‚ùå False ‚Äì The number of boiler houses was not a significant variable.  
- **Hypothesis 3:** ‚úÖ True ‚Äì A higher number of marriages led to a statistically significant increase in workplace accidents (+0.41 victims per unit increase).  
- **Hypothesis 4:** ‚úÖ True ‚Äì Higher investment expenditures per capita were associated with more workplace accidents (+0.08 victims per PLN increase).  

## **Tools & Methods**  
- **Programming Languages:** Python, Gretl  
- **Statistical Methods:**
  - Descriptive statistics  
  - Stepwise regression  
  - Hellwig‚Äôs method  
  - Model diagnostics (heteroskedasticity, multicollinearity, residual normality tests)  
  - Prediction with confidence intervals
